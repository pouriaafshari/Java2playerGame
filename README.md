# Project 5 (with Warhammer theme)

## Overview

This project is a two-player game where players select characters and then play a game on a 4x4 board. The objective of the game is to be the player who makes the last move by removing stones from the board.

## Game Rules

1. The game board consists of a 4x4 grid of cells, each containing a piece of stone.
2. Players take turns to move.
3. On their turn, a player must choose a non-empty row or column and remove 1 to 4 adjacent stones from it.
4. If 2 or more stones are removed, they must be adjacent.
5. The player who makes the last move (removes the last stone) wins the game.

## Character Selection

Before starting the game, each player selects a character. The character selection is implemented using JavaFX. The available characters are:

- Abaddon the Despoiler
- Ahriman
- Farseer Eldrad Ulthran
- Autarch Jain Zar
- Ghazghkull Thraka
- Fabius Bile
- Yvraine, Emissary of Ynnead
- Warboss
- Kh√¢rn the Betrayer
- Huron Blackheart
- Typhus
- Lucius the Eternal
- Trazyn the Infinite
- The Swarmlord
- Asdrubael Vect

Once a character is selected by a player, the corresponding button becomes disabled to prevent the other player from choosing the same character.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The core programming language used for the game logic.
- **JavaFX**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) for character selection and the game board.
- **FXML**: Used for defining the layout of the user interface.
- **SceneBuilder**: A visual layout tool for JavaFX applications (optional).

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/INBPA0420L/homework-project-2024-pouriaafshari
